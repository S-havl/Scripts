# Scripts
Small tools, command-line scripts, and random experiments I wrote to automate tasks or test concepts.

# Scripts

This repo contains small command-line scripts and automation tools I’ve written during my learning process.

Most of them started as test files — just a way to try something.  
Some are random ideas I had and turned into small Bash or Python tools.  
None of this is meant to be final or clean. This is raw practice.

## What You'll Find Here

- Bash scripts to automate things in Linux
- Python tools that helped me learn logic and file handling
- Mini projects I used to test subprocesses, parsing, and file manipulation
- Stuff that was just fun to build, even if pointless

## Why This Repo Exists

I learn best by writing code — even if it’s broken or useless at first.  
These scripts are how I test what I’ve learned in theory.

Sometimes a few lines of code teach more than ten tutorials.

## Languages Used

- Bash
- Python
- A bit of C and Assembly
